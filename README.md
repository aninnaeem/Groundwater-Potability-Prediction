# Groundwater-Potability-Prediction
Overview
This repository contains code for predicting groundwater potability using machine learning techniques. The provided code implements a machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, model training and tuning, ensemble modeling, and evaluation. The goal is to build models that can predict whether a given sample of groundwater is potable or not based on various features.

Introduction
Groundwater potability is an essential factor in ensuring access to safe drinking water. This project focuses on predicting groundwater potability using machine learning models. Two main algorithms, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are used individually and as an ensemble to make predictions based on various features extracted from the dataset.

How the Code Works
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file containing information about different features related to groundwater quality. Missing values are imputed using mean imputation, and the data is split into features (X) and target (y).

Data Splitting: The dataset is further divided into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.

Feature Scaling: Standard scaling is applied to the features to normalize them, ensuring that different scales do not impact the models' performance.

Model Implementation and Hyperparameter Tuning: Both Random Forest and SVM models are implemented using the scikit-learn library. Hyperparameters are tuned using grid search and cross-validation to find the best-performing configuration for each model.

Ensemble Model: An ensemble model is created using a VotingClassifier that combines the best-tuned Random Forest and SVM models. The ensemble makes predictions based on a majority vote from individual models.

Model Evaluation: The accuracy of each individual model and the ensemble model is calculated using the accuracy_score function. Additionally, classification reports are generated to provide insights into precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Visualization: A bar chart is created to visualize and compare the accuracies of the individual models and the ensemble model.

Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the code:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Place the dataset file (water_potability.csv) in the same directory as the code.
Run the code using a Python interpreter.
Results
The code generates classification reports for each individual model (Random Forest and SVM) as well as the ensemble model. These reports provide insights into the precision, recall, F1-score, and other metrics for each class. The bar chart visualization shows a comparison of the accuracies of the models.
